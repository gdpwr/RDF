# 🌍 Renewable Data Framework (RDF)

The **Renewable Data Framework (RDF)** is the first open-source standard for renewable energy siting and permitting data.  
It provides a **common language** across the full clean energy lifecycle — from **site identification** to **permitting**, **legislation**, **project execution**, and **community signals**.

RDF is founded by **GoodPower**, convened by **Roger Lopez (Chief Growth & Data Officer)**, and developed collaboratively with the clean energy ecosystem.

## 📖 Mission
Enable collaboration, transparency, and acceleration of clean energy deployment by creating an **open, modular, interoperable data framework**.

---

## 🧩 Core Domains
- **Site Identification** → location, land use, transmission, environmental overlays.
- **Permitting & Process** → permit type, jurisdiction, status, timeline, risk.
- **Legislation & Policy** → bills, jurisdictions, sponsors, stages.
- **Project Execution** → developer, capacity (MW), milestones, operational status.
- **Community & Opposition Signals** → hearings, lawsuits, protests, disinformation.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Starting Point
- **Schemas** in JSON/GeoJSON format.
- **SQL templates** for Postgres, BigQuery, and Snowflake.
- **Sample datasets** (GeoJSON/CSV) to demonstrate real-world use.
- **Versioning** using semantic versioning (v0.1 → v1.0).

---

## 📅 Roadmap
- **2025 Q4** → RDF v0.1 release (Site Identification schema).
- **2026 H1** → Expand to Permits, Legislation, Projects, Signals.
- **2026 H2** → Convene RDF Working Group.
- **2027** → RDF v1.0 public release.

---

## 📜 Licensing
- **MIT License** → Schema definitions.
- **CC BY 4.0** → Documentation & datasets.
